/**
 * A bounded split that reads the full primary-key state of a bucket via the server-side kv scan.
 * Emitted by the enumerator for every bucket of a primary-key table when the source is running in
 * bounded mode under {@code client.scanner.kv.batch-strategy = server-scan}, and the table has no
 * lake snapshot to union-read from.
 *
 * <p>This split has no resumable position: on Flink task restart the bucket is rescanned from
 * scratch, so rows already emitted are emitted again. The server pins one RocksDB snapshot per
 * scanner session, which makes a bucket internally consistent as of the moment {@code ScanKv} opens
 * it — buckets are opened as readers reach them, so a full scan is not consistent across buckets.
 * The client cannot resume an expired or invalidated session, so progress is not checkpointed.
 *
 * <p>Unlike {@link HybridSnapshotLogSplit}, this split has no log handoff phase: when the bucket is
 * drained the split is marked finished.
